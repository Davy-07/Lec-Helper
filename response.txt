- Electromagnetism is a force of nature that was studied separately from electricity and magnetism early on. 
- Hans Christian Ã˜rsted discovered that electric currents give rise to magnetism and Michael Faraday discovered that magnetism could induce electric currents. 
- James Clerk Maxwell put the whole thing together in a unified theory of electromagnetism and Maxwell's equations further indicated that electromagnetic waves existed.
